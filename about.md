Crew was founded in 2018. We started out with two people, and today we’re a company of about 10 spread out across 6 different cities around Sri Lanka. Our headquarters is in Colombo, but everyone at Crew is free to live and work wherever they want. Many of us love working remotely!

We’re designers, programmers, tinkerers, writers, speakers, bikers, engineers, runners, developers, chefs, analysts, campers, musicians, filmmakers, knitters, hikers, authors, photographers, pilots, race car drivers, readers, travelers, gardeners, volunteers, parents, and hard workers.

### Always at your service

If you have a general question for us, just drop us an email at hi@crew.com and we’ll get back to you within a day. If you’re a customer, and you want to talk to someone in customer service, drop an email to support@crew.lk and we’ll get back to you right away.

If you’re just browsing, enjoy your stay. If you’d like to become a customer, we’d love to have you. Either way, thanks for visiting Crew
