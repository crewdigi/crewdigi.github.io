Crew was founded in 2018. We started out with two people, and today we’re a company of about 10 spread out across 6 different cities around Sri Lanka. Our headquarters is in Colombo, but everyone at Crew is free to live and work wherever they want. Many of us love working remotely!

We’re designers, programmers, tinkerers, writers, speakers, bikers, engineers, runners, developers, chefs, analysts, campers, musicians, filmmakers, knitters, hikers, authors, photographers, deep ocean divers, race car drivers, readers, travelers, gardeners, volunteers, parents, and hard workers.

Please help us to spread the word of mouth about what we do and who we are, as we are a young start-up it will mean allot for us.
