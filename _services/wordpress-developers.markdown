Our team always loves an interesting challenge, and has the experience necessary to make your project a resounding success. While our team of designers and researchers have the capability to take on just about anything you throw at us, here are a few areas we specialize in:



### Web Applications
Web apps are the backbone of today’s most popular SaaS products. We’ll lay the foundation for success by conducting competitive research and market analysis to help you position your product and open up opportunities. When it comes time to design we’ll use sketches, prototypes and wireframes, and even build insight maps that pull in analytics, demographic research and customer feedback to drive business outcomes.


### Data Driven Sites
The average person now spends more time online than with all other media outlets combined. Your organization’s or product’s website has the power to connect you to billions of people around the globe. We’ll use audits, interviews and testing to pull out insights that will help us build storylines that will resonate with your audience. We’ll use these insights to create a volume of prototypes with lo, mid and hi fidelity wireframes for rapid user & concept testing. The result will be a coded styleguide with every component your team needs to grow your presence on the web.


### eCommerce Sites
Consumers are moving from brick and mortar stores to online shops in record numbers. Our team can help you optimize your checkout flows, create a seamless shopping experience on mobile, and identify and fix any leaks in the funnel.


### Web Portals
From intranets of companies like eBay to government website admins, our team has the front-end and back-end experience to design and build intuitive systems that are able to present a complex array of information in the most user-friendly way possible.



### Mobile Apps

Mobile devices are integral parts of modern life. Over 50% of smartphone users grab their phone immediately after waking up in the morning, and spend an average of 3 hours per day using it to view and interact with digital media. iOs or Android, simple or complex, our team can help you design an incredible native app. We’ll start by auditing your existing products and/or the competition, and then begin building comprehensive prototypes that demonstrate complex interactions, animation, gestures and visual design. All through the process we’ll be conducting regular user testing so we can surface design insights and validate concepts.

### Email Design
The number of active email accounts worldwide was roughly 4.1 billion in 2014 and is expected to increase to nearly 5.6 billion towards the end of 2019. As email becomes more and more of a major component in products and services, companies need to take a holistic view of how this system works together to provide the best experience for the user. Our team can design and code the emails, identify and construct the triggers and and user paths, set up analytics, and build an email styleguide for both marketing and transactional emails. We can also assist with email lifecycle planning to target and engage customers better, increase conversion and promote best practices.
